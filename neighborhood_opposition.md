# Neighborhood Opposition to City Realty's 18 Robeson St Proposal

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the key arguments against City Realty's development proposal for 18 Robeson St, supported by neighborhood residents. The opposition is based on zoning concerns, potential structural damage to surrounding properties, environmental impact, the developer's poor track record, and lack of community benefit.

## Key Opposition Points

### 1. Non-Buildable Lot Status
- City Realty has attempted for 12 years to overcome zoning challenges
- Current proposal includes a convoluted single-family condo arrangement
- The lot is not comparable to 16R Robeson St in size
- 16R was a separately deeded lot

### 2. Construction and Environmental Concerns
- High risk of damage to 100+ year old nearby houses built on puddingstone ledge
- Removal of multiple mature trees, including destruction of the largest tree on 22 Robeson St
- Loss of habitat and privacy for surrounding properties
- Excessive building size (50' wide by 24' deep x 30'+ high) on a small parcel
- Proposed building would be less than 30' from the side walls of 17 Rocky Nook Terrace
- Potential drainage issues affecting downhill properties due to disturbance of a natural aquaduct running through the puddingstone cliff

### 3. Developer's Poor Track Record
- City Realty has been a troublesome neighbor
- Refused to remove deteriorated, dangerous barn for years
- Inspectional Services failed to enforce removal requirements
- Property maintenance issues including trash accumulation and parking lot deterioration
- Unreliable and misleading plans regarding parking, slope assessment, and rear staircase

### 4. Lack of Community Benefit
- No compelling purpose beyond developer profit
- Does not address neighborhood need for affordable housing

### 5. United Neighborhood Opposition
- Residents are united in opposition to this development

## Detailed Concerns

### Building Size and Positioning
- Structure would be 50' x 24' x 30.5', occupying the maximum space permissible by zoning
- Minimum setbacks in all directions
- Building would be extremely close to 17 Rocky Nook Terrace
- Property line will be just 7 feet from the adjacent 22 Robeson St property

### Retaining Wall Issues
- Retaining wall will be only 2-3 feet from the property line
- See reference sheets A-2.1 and A-3.01

### Tree and Environmental Impact
- Requires removal of several mature trees on site
- Will likely kill a very large tree located on 22 Robeson Street's parcel
- Images provided by City Realty show a large tree remaining along the property line between 18 Robeson and 16R Robeson that will likely be removed or killed during construction
- Further loss of privacy for Rocky Nook residents and 16R Robeson

### Terrain and Site Plan Concerns
- Low confidence in City Realty's depiction of the building and site layout
- Misrepresentation of the terrain and steep slope of pudding rock along the property line
- Plans fail to show terrain beyond the retaining walls (see sheets A-3.00, A-3.01, A-3.02, A-2.1)
- Unclear handling of slope between building and 17 Rocky Nook parcel
- No clear drainage plan; disruption of natural aquaduct running through the puddingstone hill
- Maximum elevation shown as 114', but this appears to be at the retaining wall, not the property line
- Sheet A-3.02 shows elevation maxing at 114' behind parking area, falling short of property line

### Access and Infrastructure Issues
- City Realty apparently intends to remove existing concrete staircase leading from driveway to rear entrance
- No clear plan for how occupants will access the parking area
- Sheet A-2.4 appears to misrepresent the situation by showing stairs that cannot coexist with the parking plan
- Unexplained fence/handrail along retaining wall adjacent to parking area (Sheet A-3.02)
- Parking on a steep slope (3.5-4' height difference over ~20')
- No clear drainage plan for parking area, creating risk of water pooling or redirecting toward 16R Robeson
- Questionable plans to build above ledge without removing rock/ledge

## Community Perspective
Every other residential building in this neighborhood is owner-occupied. City Realty's persistent attempts to extract profit from this parcel highlights the difference between resident homeowners who want to improve the community and developers who prioritize profit over community impact.
